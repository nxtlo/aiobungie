## [0.2.6a1](https://github.com/nxtlo/aiobungie/compare/0.2.6a0...0.2.6a1) 2022-03-05

## Major API changes

- All methods that used to take `*components` now take a list of component types instead.
- All components should be passed as is without unpacking nor using the `.value` attribute.

- The `auth` parameter is now exposed as an actual parameter and not a kwarg.

Example
```py
await client.fetch_profile(
    ...,
    components=[aiobungie.ComponentType.ALL_PROFILES, aiobungie.ComponentType.CHARACTERS, ...],
    auth="..."
)
```

## Added
- Included all activities in `FireteamActivity`.
- Standard `FlatIterator` and `into_iter` in `internal.iterators` and exported to the project's namespace.

Example usage
```py
import aiobungie

client = aiobungie.Client()

friends = await client.fetch_friends(...)

# This can either be used with `async for` or `for`

async for friend in (
    aiobungie.into_iter(friends) # Transform the sequence into a flat iterator.
    .filter(lambda friend: friend.type is MembershipType.STEAM)  # Filter to only steam friends.
    .take(5)  # Limit the results to 5 friends
    .discard(lambda friend: friend.online_status is Presence.ONLINE)  # Drop friends that are not online.
    .reversed()  # Reverse them.
):
    print(friend.unique_name)
```
