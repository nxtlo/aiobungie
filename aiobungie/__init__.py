"""A Pythonic `async`/`await` wrapper for interacting with the Bungie API.

Base client.

Example
-------
```py
import aiobungie

client = aiobungie.Client('YOUR_API_KEY')

# Search for Destiny2 users.
async def main() -> None:
    users = await client.search_users('Crit')

    # Iterate over the users and take the first 5 results.
    for user in users.take(5):
        print(f'{user.name} ({user.code})')

        # Iterate through the users memberships.
        for membership in user.memberships:
            print(membership.type, membership.id)

client.run(main()) # or asyncio.run(main())
```

Single RESTClient instance.

The difference between base client and the REST clients:

* No Hight-Level concepts.
* All returned data are pure JSON objects from the API.
* No object creation.

Example
-------
```py
import aiobungie

async def main() -> None:
    # Using `async with` context manager to close the session properly.
    async with aiobungie.RESTClient("TOKEN") as rest:
        payload = await rest.fetch_player('Fateæ€’', 4275)

        for membership in payload:
            print(membership['membershipId'], membership['iconPath'])

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

REST client pool.

A REST client pool allows you to acquire multiple `RESTClient` instances that shares the same connection.

Example
-------
```py
import aiobungie
import asyncio

pool = aiobungie.RESTPool("token")

async def func1() -> None:
    async with pool.acquire() as instance:
        tokens = await instance.fetch_oauth2_tokens('code')
        pool.metadata['tokens'] = tokens

# Other instance may access the tokens from pool since its shared.

async def func2() -> None:
    async with pool.acquire() as instance:
        tokens = pool.metadata['tokens']
        tokens = await instance.refresh_access_token(tokens.refresh_token)

async def main() -> None:
    await asyncio.gather(func1(), func2())

asyncio.run(main())
```

Should you use the base client or the REST client?
This returns to you. For an example if you're building a website.

You can use python as a REST API in the backend with the RESTClient since all returned object are JSON objects.
Which gives you the freedom to deserialize it and implement your own logic in the front-end.

Or of you're building a Discord bot for an example or something simple. The base client is the way to go.
