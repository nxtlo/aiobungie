"""A Pythonic `async`/`await` wrapper for interacting with the Bungie API.

Example
-------
A Basic aiobungie API client.

```py
import aiobungie

# crates in aiobungie are implementations
# of Bungie's objects to provide
# more functionality.
# See aiobungie.crate to view all the implemented objects.

client = aiobungie.Client('YOUR_API_KEY')

# An example on how to search for Destiny 2 users/memberships and get their characters.
async def main() -> None:
    users = await client.search_users('Fate')
    for user in users:
        if user.code == 868:
            print('Found the desired user!', user.name, user.bungie_id)

            # Iterate through the user's memberships.
            for membership in user.memberships:
                if membership.type is aiobungie.MembershipType.STEAM:
                    try:
                        # Fetch the membership's profile and get characters component.
                        my_profile = await membership.fetch_self_profile(aiobungie.ComponentType.CHARACTERS)

                    # Handle the error.
                    except aiobungie.CharacterError as exc:
                        print(f'Couldn't get {user.name}'s characters. Due to: {exc.message}')
                        return

                    else:
                        # Will return a Mapping from the character's id to `aiobungie.crate.Character` object.
                        for character_id, character in my_profile.characters.items():
                            print(character_id, character)

client.run(main()) # or asyncio.run(main())
```

A basic RESTful client.

The difference between base client and the REST one are:

* No Hight-Level concepts. Just interact with the API.
* All returned data are pure JSON objects from Bungie's API.
* No runtime assertions.

Which lets you to implement your own logic, classes objects to get the desired results.

```py
import aiobungie

async def main() -> None:
    # Using `async with` context manager to close the session properly.
    async with aiobungie.RESTClient("TOKEN") as rest:
        # Fetch the memberships of a Destiny 2 player.
        payload = await rest.fetch_player('Fateæ€’', 4275)
        print(*payload)  # A JSON array of dict objects of our memberships.

        for membership in payload:
            # Print the ID and icon path of each membership.
            print(membership['membershipId'], membership['iconPath'])

            # Printing the icon URL.
            icon_url = aiobungie.Image(membership['iconPath'])
            print(icon_url)

            for k, v in membership.items(): # key, value
                print(k, v)

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

Should you use the base client or the REST client?
This returns to you. For an example if you're building a website.

You can use python as a REST API in the backend with the RESTClient since all returned object are JSON objects.
Which gives you the freedom to deserialize it and implement your own logic in the front-end.

Or of you're building a Discord bot for an example or something simple. The base client is the way to go.
