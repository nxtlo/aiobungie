"""A statically typed, asynchronous API wrapper for building clients for Bungie's API in Python.

### Getting Started

This is the basic client you probably want you start with.

```py
import aiobungie

client = aiobungie.Client('YOUR_API_KEY', client_secret='KEY', client_id=0)

async def main() -> None:
    async with client.rest:
        # Search for Destiny 2 memberships.
        users = await client.search_users('Crit')

        # Iterate over the users and take the first 5 results.
        for user in users.take(5):
            # Print the user name and their code.
            print(f'{user.name} {user.code}')

# aiobungie provides an internal function to run async functions.
# It's equivalent to asyncio.run()
client.run(main()) # or asyncio.run(main())
```

### RESTClient

aiobungie provides a second way to use Bungie's API,

a single `RESTClient` allows you to make requests and return JSON objects immediately.

This bypasses the need to deserialize and create objects. It also exposes all `OAuth2` and `manifest` methods.
This can be faster for `REST` apis.

This is considered the core client since `aiobungie.Client` is built on top of it.
Using the `.rest` property allows direct access to the raw REST client instance.


```py
import aiobungie
import asyncio

client = aiobungie.RESTClient("TOKEN")

async def main() -> None:
    async with client as rest:
        payload = await rest.fetch_membership('Fateæ€’', 4275)

        for membership in payload:
            print(membership['membershipId'])

asyncio.run(main())
```

### RESTPool

A REST client pool allows you to acquire multiple `RESTClient` that share the same state.

This is useful when you want to spawn an instance for each client which shared the same state.

```py
import aiobungie
import asyncio

pool = aiobungie.RESTPool("token")

async def set() -> None:
    # Set your ID to access it from other places.
    pool.metadata['my_id'] = 4401
    async with pool.acquire() as instance:
        ...

async def fetch() -> None:
    my_id: int = pool.metadata['my_id']
    async with pool.acquire() as instance: # A different client instance.
        my_user = instance.fetch_bungie_user(my_id)

await asyncio.gather(set(), fetch())
```

### When should you use which client?
* Use `Client` when you want to build a Chat Bot, Discord Bot, access data as Python classes.
* Use `RESTClient` when you want one TCP session for all clients, access data as JSON payloads.
* Use `RESTPool` when you're serving a large amount of connections and want to spawn a session for each,
access data as JSON payloads.
Note that setting up multiple TCP connections can be expensive.
