"""A Pythonic `async`/`await` framework / wrapper for interacting with the Bungie API.

A basic client based example.

```py

import aiobungie
from aiobungie import crate

# crates in aiobungie are implementations
# of Bungie's objects to provide
# more functionality.
# See aiobungie.crate to view all the implemented objects.

client = aiobungie.Client(key='YOUR_API_KEY')

async def main() -> None:
    users = await client.search_users('Indica')
    for user in users:
        if user.type is aiobungie.MembershipType.STEAM and user.code == 868:
            print('Found the user', user.name, user.id, user.type)

        try:
            character = await client.fetch_character(
                user.id, user.type, aiobungie.MembershipType.HUNTER)
        except aiobungie.CharacterError exc:
            print(f'Couldn't get {user.name}'s hunter character. Due to: {exc}')
        else:
            print(character.light, character.id, character.emblem, character.class_type)

client.run(main()) # or asyncio.run(main())
```

A basic REST only client.

The difference between base client and the REST one are:

* No Hight-Level concepts. Just interact with Bungie's API.
* All returned data are pure JSON objects from Bungie's API.
* No runtime assertions.

Which lets you to implement your own logic, classes objects to get the desired results.

```py

import aiobungie

client = aiobungie.RESTClient(key='YOUR_API_KEY')

async def main() -> None:
    fetch_player = await client.fetch_player('Fateæ€’#4275') # First player in the array. Always returns one player.
    print(*player)
    for player in fetch_player:
        print(player['membershipId'], player['iconPath'])
        for k, v in fetch_player:
            print(k, v)

import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

Should you use the base client or the REST client?
This returns to you. For an example if you're building a website.
You can use python as a REST API in the backend with the RESTClient since all returned object are JSON objects.
Which gives you the freedom to deserialize it and implement you own logic in the front-end.

Or of you're building a Discord bot for an example or something simple. The base client is the way to go.
