"""An example on how to download and use Destiny2 Manifest.

aiobungie's REST interface provides 5 methods to interact with the manifest.

* fetch_manifest_path
This fetch the manifest path calling `Destiny2/Manifest` endpoint and return
JSON response contains all available data.

* read_manifest_bytes
This can be used to read the raw bytes of the SQLite version manifest.
Its a low-levelish method to read and write the bytes yourself.

* download_manifest
This is the standard method to download the SQLite manifest.
It will read, write, zip, unzip and prepare the manifest file to be used.

* download_json_manifest
Same as download_manifest but it will download the JSON manifest instead of SQLite.

* fetch_manifest_version
Lookups the current manifest version.
